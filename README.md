## Lab Objective in Bioinformatics Analysis
The objective is to **analyze gene coexpression networks (GCNs) in elderly cells compared to younger cells**, with the broader aim of applying these methodologies to **cancer research**. Similar to aging cells, cancer cells exhibit difficulties in regulating cell division and are increasingly prone to genetic mutations.  

**Bioinformatics significance:**  
Accurately building and analyzing coexpression networks is essential for identifying key genes, understanding their interactions, and drawing meaningful biological conclusions. This contributes to advancing research within the field of bioinformatics.

## Network Analysis
By constructing **GCNs** from gene expression data of both age groups, we can investigate structural and functional differences between the networks.  

**Key Network Characteristics for Analysis:**  
- **Graph Density** – overall connectedness of the network  
- **Node Expression** – individual gene activity levels  
- **Edge Co-expression** – strength of coexpression between gene pairs  
- **Largest Connected Component (LCC) Size & Density** – size and connectivity of the main network cluster  
- **Effective Number of Components** – number of independent sub-networks  
- **Degree Assortativity** – tendency of nodes to connect with similar-degree nodes  
- **Percolation Threshold** – network resilience to node or edge removal  
- **Node Degree** – number of connections per gene  
- **Node Harmonic Centrality** – influence of a node based on distances to all other nodes
